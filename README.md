# Sqwiggle API Documentation

## Work In Progress

The Sqwiggle API is not yet public, this documentation is a work in process and the endpoints defined 
within can not yet be accessed.

This project forms the backbone of the Sqwiggle API documentation, for a more readable/browseable version
please check out the formatted documentation on our website: https://www.sqwiggle.com/api

object we'd love to know about it. Go ahead and fork and submit a pull request - we'll hook you up with
something cool as a thankyou.
