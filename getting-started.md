Welcome to the Sqwiggle API, it's great to have you taking a look at how to integrate
with Sqwiggle, we think our API allows for some pretty neat hacks, apps and more! 

The Sqwiggle API is architected in a REST style - it is designed to have predictable, 
resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use 
built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood 
by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

At this time the only response format is JSON and this is the default format returned by 
the API.
