# Libraries

We're working on libraries to make the Sqwiggle API as easy to use as possible in your favourite language! If you've written an API wrapper for Sqwiggle be sure to [let us know](https://www.sqwiggle.com/contact) and we'll feature it here.

## Ruby
We've written a [fantastic gem](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ruby) for you Ruby-heads out there. It wraps all of the current API functionality in the familiar ActiveRecord style. Check out the github page for installation instructions.

## ObjectiveC
Our [ObjectiveC SDK](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ios-sdk) is a work in progress that isn't quite ready for prime time. We're accepting contributions if you want to help out!

## PHP
Isern Palaus has written a great [SDK for PHP](https://github.com/ipalaus/sqwiggle-php-sdk) that makes interacting with the Sqwiggle API as easy as pie. Check out the github page for installation instructions.
