# Libraries

We're working on libraries to make the Sqwiggle API as easy to use as possible in your favourite language! If you've written an API wrapper for Sqwiggle be sure to [let us know](https://www.sqwiggle.com/contact) and we'll feature it here.

## Ruby
We've written a [fantastic gem](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ruby) for you Ruby-heads out there. It wraps all of the current API functionality in the familiar ActiveRecord style. Check out the github page for installation instructions.

## ObjectiveC (iOS-Only)
Our [ObjectiveC SDK](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ios-sdk) is ready to rock! It's readily available on [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=Sqwigg) for easy integration into your project. <b>NOTE:</b> OS X is not officially supported just yet, but [we have plans to change that](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-ios-sdk/issues/24).

## PHP
Isern Palaus has written a great [SDK for PHP](https://github.com/ipalaus/sqwiggle-php-sdk) that makes interacting with the Sqwiggle API as easy as pie. Check out the github page for installation instructions.

## Node.js
We've written an awesome [npm module](https://github.com/sqwiggle/sqwiggle-node) that makes API integration a snap with some simple service objects. Check out the github page for installation instructions.
