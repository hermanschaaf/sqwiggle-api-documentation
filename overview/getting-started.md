# Getting Started

__Welcome to the Sqwiggle API, it's great to have you taking a look at how to integrate
with Sqwiggle, we think our API allows for some pretty neat hacks, apps and more!__

The API is architected in a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) style - it is designed to have predictable, 
resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use 
built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood 
by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.


## Clients
In order to use the Sqwiggle API you'll first need to create a client and generate a token, you can do
so here: [https://www.sqwiggle.com/company/clients](https://www.sqwiggle.com/company/clients).

## Endpoints
All API requests are made to **https://api.sqwiggle.com/** and all requests are served over HTTPS.

## Formats
At this time the only response format support is JSON and as such is the default format returned by 
the API.
